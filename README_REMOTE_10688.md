A bunch of tools to work with CASIO calculators.

The files should be self-explanatory.
(either from the file name or the containing comments)

Submodules:

* `CasioEmu`: The disassembler and emulator. Necessary for some tools to work.

See also:

* https://github.com/user202729/U8DevTool - CD image of U8 development tools.
Install this to work with `parse_obj.py` and some `wine_tools`. Not necessary
for the emulator or the compiler.
